          Podcast But Outside (PBO) is a comedy podcast hosted by Cole Hersch
          and Andrew Michaan, combining a man-on-the-street interview style with
          deadpan humor. Both hosts have backgrounds in comedy writing, standup,
          and social media fame.

        <p class="casestudy__text">
          My website redesign embraces the offbeat quirkiness of the podcast’s
          brand, welcoming the audience with hand-drawn elements and playful
          themes.

          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="casestudy__text">
          After viewing the original website, I noted some of the pain points
          that I observed. These included:
        </p>

        <ul class="casestudy__ul">
          <li class="casestudy__text casestudy__text_li">
            Poor color contrast and poor text legibility
          </li>
          <li class="casestudy__text casestudy__text_li">
            No pagination or filter on video gallery, creating an endless scroll
          </li>
          <li class="casestudy__text casestudy__text_li">
            The website has no home page, so the user does not get an overview
            of the site or impression of the podcast's personality
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="casestudy__text">
          One benefit of the existing site is its simplicity. Text is kept to a
          minimum, and there’s no visual mess competing for attention on the
          screen. In my redesign, I wanted to keep this simplicity but add more
          on-brand humor to the site’s interface. My challenge was maintaining a
          balance of efficiency and delightful design. Too much focus on
          efficiency would detract from the design, and too much focus on design
          would distract the user from navigating the site.
        </p>

        <h2 class="casestudy__header">creating a proto-persona</h2>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          During this project, one limitation was that I did not interview the
          actual user base of the existing website. Since I did not have that
          data, I created a proto-persona based of my assumptions of the Podcast
          But Outside’s target demographic. The profile is based on an overview
          of fans who interact with the podcast on social media and commenters
          from the YouTube videos.
        </p>

        <div class="casestudy__img-container">
          <picture>
            <source
              media="(max-width:450px)"

            />
            <source

            <img class="casestudy__img-single" src="img/userpersona.png" />
          </picture>
        </div>

        <p class="casestudy__text">
          I noted the importance of social media marketing as a way of updating
          fans and showing the hosts' personalities. Therefore, the visibility
          of social media icons on the website became a priority in the
          redesign. Additionally, most fans seemed to be either millennials or
          part of Gen Z, so these digital natives expect websites to be engaging
          and upfront with content.
        </p>

        <h2 class="casestudy__header">hand-drawn & down to earth</h2>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          When I was considering how to show the personality of the podcast, my
          brainstorming started out broad. I asked myself: what kind of shapes
          will I use? What visuals does the Podcast But Outside use on social
          media? How do the podcasters want to be seen? And I searched for the
          answers by watching podcast episodes on YouTube and digging into their
          social media presences.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          Through this inquiry, I found that the podcast uses illustrations with
          black lineart and bright colors. I also considered the low-budget
          production value and how to embrace it in my design. Most prominently,
          the podcast hosts use a folding table and a paper sign when they
          conduct interviews. This is what inspired the collaged cut-out design
          shown in the prototype. Below, I've included an example of a social
          media graphic and the podcast's setup.
        </p>

        <p class="casestudy__text">
          As I began to create the components necessary for the prototype, I
          drew out the elements on paper and converted them to vector images on
          Illustrator. This achieved the hand-drawn, one-of-a-kind look that
          matched the podcast's existing branding.
        </p>

        <div class="casestudy__img-container">

        <h2 class="casestudy__header">page 01: home</h2>
        <h3 class="project__caption bolder">design</h3>
        <div class="casestudy__img-container">

        </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          For the home page, I wanted to visually represent the “outside”
          element of the podcast with the hosts standing in front of an outdoor
          background. After experimenting with a few ideas, I added the cloud
          background and realized that it had the most potential. From this
          starting point, I added a green graphic to represent grass, and
          created a cut-out image of the hosts to place on top. I also included
          cloud graphics in the navigation bar to further integrate the cloud
          imagery.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          At the mobile breakpoint, I removed the grass to simplify the design.
          Additionally, the mobile home page does not scroll and instead prompts
          the user to swipe into the interior pages. All the changes on smaller
          breakpoints were influenced by legibility and simplicity.
        </p>
        <h3 class="project__caption bolder">interaction</h3>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          The first animation the user sees on the website is the slow cloud
          movement. This is consistent across all breakpoints and adds a touch
          of realism and interest to the design.
        </p>
        <div class="casestudy__img-container">

        <p class="casestudy__text">
          On desktop, the pictures in the Merch category slightly rotate on
          hover. I made this choice to encourage interaction with products and
          add personality to the page.
        </p>
        <h2 class="casestudy__header">navigation menu</h2>
        <div class="casestudy__img-container">

          <p></p>
        </div>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          The navigation menu echoes visual branding elements from other parts
          of the website. On mobile, the menu features colored rectangles and
          stars. On desktop, the menu features drawn clouds.
        </p>
        <h2 class="casestudy__header">page 02: live shows</h2>

        </div>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          The live shows page lists upcoming tour dates and links fans to a
          ticket purchasing site. Instead of a traditional list view, I used
          graphic representations of tickets with the information listed on each
          ticket. Tour dates are organized by region, since buyers are looking
          for venues closest to them.
        </p>

        <h3 class="project__caption bolder">interaction</h3>
        <div class="casestudy__img-container">
          <img class="casestudy__img-single medium" "lazy"

        </div>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          The user navigates the page by tapping stars to view regions. The
          tickets change accordingly, displaying related tour dates and
          information.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          You may have noticed that the tablet breakpoint features a blue
          gradient at the bottom of the screen. When I made the tablet layout,
          the page had a sense of emptiness. The desktop footer gives the
          breakpoint a sense of finality, and the small screen size of mobile
          benefits from minimalism. However, I still felt like the tablet needed
          more. I thought about how the user holds a tablet, with the bottom of
          the screen closer to them, and I realized this was an opportunity to
          add depth. So, I added the gradient to add dimension to the screen.
        </p>
        <h2 class="casestudy__header">page 03: episodes</h2>
        <h3 class="project__caption bolder">design</h3>
        <div class="casestudy__img-container">
          <img class="casestudy__img-single" "lazy" src="img/episodes.png" />
        </div>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          For the episodes page, each thumbnail has a unique twist, adding
          interest to the grid layout. Although each breakpoint has a slightly
          different design, the skewed color blocks remain consistent.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          To combat endless scrolling and create structure, the page has
          pagination on desktop and tablet. On mobile, the natural movement is
          to scroll down, so the pagination is replaced with a "load more"
          button. All breakpoints have a "sort by" feature to improve
          navigation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="project__caption bolder">interaction</h3>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          The desktop hover interaction implies clickability, and the other
          interactions are minimal to enforce focus on the content itself. On
          mobile, a "back to top" button appears on scroll.
        </p>
        <h2 class="casestudy__header">Final Result</h2>
        <p class="casestudy__text">
          In my redesign of the Podcast But Outside website, I aimed to
          strengthen the brand voice with engaging graphics and playful design
          choices.
        </p>

        <p class="casestudy__text">
          Since this was a personal project, I experimented with creative
          solutions. Due to the limited resources of this project, I assumed the
          user pain-points and goals. If this project was for a real client, I
          would interview the existing user base and talk to the client about
          their branding and marketing goals. The design would be rooted in
          contextual inquiry and the core mission of the Podcast But Outside.
